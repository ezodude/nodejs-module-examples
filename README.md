# NodeJS module examples

Simple examples of different flavors to create modules in NodeJS

----------------------------

* basic.js - just exports method as they are
* singleton.js - exports a singleton object and its methods
* obj-instance.js - exports an object constructor to initialize object before it's usage
* obj-instance.js - exports an object instantiated at runtime - also consructor to show up the difference
* test-server.js - an example including all the different *require* methods
